## 🤖 AI Assistance Guidelines

### How AI Estimates Work
When estimating with AI tools (Cursor AI, Claude, GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.), consider:

- **Code Generation:** AI can generate boilerplate code, tests, and documentation (30-50% time savings)
- **Code Review:** AI assists in finding bugs and suggesting improvements (20-30% time savings)
- **Problem Solving:** AI helps debug issues and suggest solutions (25-40% time savings)
- **Documentation:** AI generates technical docs and comments (40-60% time savings)

### AI Effectiveness by Task Type
- 🟢 **High Impact (40-60% savings):** Boilerplate code, tests, documentation, IaC templates
- 🟡 **Medium Impact (20-40% savings):** API development, refactoring, bug fixes
- 🔴 **Low Impact (10-20% savings):** Complex architecture, security implementation, performance optimization
